    # To use this code for preprocessing, you need a file structure:  
    #         /Databasesname/Samplename/Images_or_Labels/file
    # Databasesname: the databases folder
    # Samplename: each MRI data sample (all the modalities of that sample are included in this folder )
    # Images_or_Labels: two folders under the sample folder: Images , Labels 
    # file: The Images folder includes files with different modalities, showing names such as modalities.nii.gz (e.g. FLAIR.nii.gz). You can also put the brain mask in this file if you have as (MASK.nii.gz) For the Labels folder: it only contains one file (label.nii.gz)
    # For saving the preprocessed data, you need a file structure as 
    # /Databasesname/Images_or_Labels
    # Then, you need to change the setting in the code
    # 1. change the Data_set_path to the location of your database
    # 2. change the modality name 
    # 3. change the save path to the location that you want for the preprocessed data
    # The intensity normalization methods we used need brain masks. You can use the brain masks you get from skull strip tools or the database. If you can't get you can use the get brain mask methods 
    # This code is similar to preprocess.py but it also flip the images
